# guest
guestbook with MongoDB

This was a school project in which we worked on the previously created guestbook, only this time we had to implement it with a database. I chose to do this excercise with the mongoDB.

I wasn't able to complete all the steps needed to gain full points. 

Criteria:

1.	Modify your guestbook so, that instead of JSON files, it will read the messages from a NoSQL database of your choice. It can be either a local database, or a database in the cloud.

2.	Modify your guestbook so, that instead of JSON files, it will save the messages in NoSQL database of your choice. It can be either a local database, or a database in the cloud.

3.	Create a new “admin” page to your guestbook app which allows the messages to be modified, for example within a form. 

4.	Create a new page to your guestbook app, which will list the messages and allow them to be deleted, for example by using checkboxes. 


So I did'nt have the time to complete the edit section of my guestbook, but the delete function is there.

Overall I did quite well in this project, and I hope that when we start our FINAL project with MEAN stack, I can build something great
